Players use machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, turrets, and grenades to kill aliens and soldiers in frenetic combat. Battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood. Some weapons/attacks result in decapitation or dismemberment that leaves bloodstains and body parts on the ground. Some finishing moves depict intense acts of violence: players can use a chainsaw-like weapon to slice enemies' necks or bodies; players can stomp on enemies' heads until they break apart. The words “sh*t” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue.",

The next age is the Castle Age, in which the powerful Castle may be built, and used to produce powerful units including the unique unit of each civilization. Finally, the user can reach the Imperial Age, which is reminiscent of the early years of the Renaissance. Once the user has reached the Imperial Age, they gain access to all the upgrades, units, and buildings that may be built and researched for their specific civilization. \n \nThe player directly controls Villagers, which are the most important economic unit in the game. The player has the power to order them to move or attack (all units except for Trade Carts, Transport Ships and Trade Cogs), construct new buildings, gather necessary resources (Villager units), and perform a range of other tasks, such as repair damaged buildings or garrison inside Castle or Town Center for safety.",

From a third-person perspective, players traverse various environments (e.g., subways, city streets, building corridors) as they avoid being attacked by zombies and large enemy creatures. Players use pistols, machine guns, shotguns, and explosives to defend themselves and kill creatures. Some attacks result in decapitation and/or dismemberment of enemies, often accompanied by large splatters of blood. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: a man executed at close range; a character impaled through the chest by a creature's tentacle. A handful of areas depict mutilated corpses/zombies with exposed organs and viscera. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the dialogue.",

Players defend the U.S. from Russian armed forces, engage in skirmishes and combat missions, and track the ultranationalist to discover clues to his movements, plans, and co-conspirators. Players use machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades, and missiles to kill enemy soldiers in frenetic, realistically-depicted combat. Action is highlighted by gunfire, explosions, blood-splatter effects, and cries of pain. The most intense depiction of violence occurs during a “No Russian” mission in which players take on the role of an undercover Ranger: several civilians are gunned down at an airport, and players are given the option to participate in the killings (e.g., players can shoot a wounded civilian crawling away) or to walk through without firing. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the dialogue.",
